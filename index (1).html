            <p class="lead">Version control works almost like a time machine. However, it doesn’t take you back in time it takes your files back in time. It allows you to access previous verisions of your files. In our class we can use it to view previous versions of our website that we make. It is very helpful in case we mess something up and want go back before the change was made if it was a major change. This will also allow us to share our fiels as well because we are using github. This will allow employers to view our work if they googled our github. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git began with a lot of controversy and was made because of necessity. With the break down between Linux kernel and Bitkeep. This prompted those in the Linux community to develop their own tools, which turned out better in the end. When they made this new system they had a few goals in mind. They used a simple design to create a fast and fully distributed platform. From using it in class, I was very surprised as to how easy it was to use. I honestly thought that when I was first introduced to it that I would have more problems with it then I did. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git stores and uses information much differently then other systems may. Git thinks about its data in a different way. Most systems store information in a list. Git doesn’t store data in this way. Git thinks of information more as a picture. It takes a snap shot of what you save. So this way git uses data as a stream of snapshots. This makes it a much better to use, as its tools are far more useful. All the time I have spent using git for this class has more then provide its usefulness. The presentation we had in class about git was very true about the importance of it.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When we started working on getting a git repository connected to my cloud 9, I was concerned because it involved linux. I’m not very good with using terminal in my past classes and it has really given me the most trouble. When I found out how simple of code it was made me pretty happy. I honestly didn’t think that working in the terminal could be so useful until this. I never really took using terminal seriously because it was so difficult. Plus anything I did in it never seemed to have any real helpful results. This was a great thing to learn.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Account</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Setting up an account in git hub and connecting it to was a much more painless process then I thought it would be. In all doing the assignment itself was much easier then I thought. However, if it wasn’t for the tutorial I probably couldn’t have figured out how to use the SSH keys. When setting up an account I have never had to use a two-factor authenticator before. It is a really useful security measure. I’m really happy to have used it along with the security that’s already in place. Using git hub has been a very pleasant and easy experience, I look forward to using it more. </p>
